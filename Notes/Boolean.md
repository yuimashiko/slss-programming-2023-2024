Booleans are a  [[Type]] of data that is either `True` or `False`
​
Booleans and [[Conditionals]] work hand-in-hand
​
They are named after the English mathematician and philosopher, [George Boole](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Boole)
​
Example:
```python
raining = True
sunny = False
```
​
# Boolean Mathematics
​
Don't let the name throw you off. Boolean math is, in my opinion, some of the most straightforward math.
​
Just like with the other maths, it has its symbols (or operators as we call them in programming).
​
## Binary Operators
​
Binary operations require **two** boolean values or expressions.
​
### Equality (`==`)
​
We use `==` to see if two booleans or boolean operations are **equal to** each other.
​
```python
True == True         # True!
True == False        # False.
False == True        # False.
False == False       # True!
```
​
Here's a practical application using equality:
​
```python
fave_food = input("What's your favourite food? ")
​
if fave_food == "pizza":
	print("I love pizza!")
```
​
### `and`
​
`and` will produce `True` if and only if **both** boolean expressions are `True`.
​
```python
raining = True
have_umbrella = False
​
if raining and have_umbrella:  # raining AND have_umbrella need to be true
	print("You came prepared for the weather!")
elif raining:
	print("You should have brought your umbrella. 💧")
```
​
### `or`
​
`or` will produce `True` if and only if at least one of the boolean expressions are `True`.
​
```python
have_bow = True
have_axe = False
​
if have_bow or have_axe:
	print("I think you're ready to fight the dragon!")
else:
	print("You need to prepare a little more for the quest.")
```
​
## Unary Operators
​
Unary operators require only **one** boolean expression.
​
### `not`
​
Not allows us to negate a boolean value. In other words, it reverses the boolean.
​
```python
sunny = False
​
if not sunny:
	print("You should probably bring your coat.")
```
​
To elaborate the case above, `not sunny` is the boolean operation. The `not` flips the boolean to the opposite value. Therefore, the code block will execute if and only if `sunny` is `False`.
