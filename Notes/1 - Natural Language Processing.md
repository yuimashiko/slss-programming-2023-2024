# Output
We can display text and symbols using output

We use the `print()` function to display output

```python
print()
```

# Comments
Comments are pieces of text that are *NOT* interpreted by Python
This means that the text is **ignored** 
We use the # symbol to make comments

# [[Headers]]

# Input
We grab information from the user using `input()`
It will wait for the user to type something in **and** press Enter/Return

```python
input()
input(<prompt>)
```

# Variables
Variables allow us to **store** information for the time our app
is running.  

```python
favourite_food = input("What is your favourite food? ")
```

`favourite_food`  -> **name** of the variable  
`=` -> **assignment** operator  
`input...` -> value 
# [[Strings]]
